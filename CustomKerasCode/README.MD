# Custom Modules for Keras

These files contain some custom Keras modules consisting of functions, layers, and losses that I found useful. 

## Layers 
Contains custom layers that I have been using in my projects. The ones that inherit Layer can be called like any other layer.
There are few that are just functions.

## Losses
Contains custom losses. The most notable one is perceptual loss and WGAN losses Keras does not support natively.

Any feedbacks are welcomed :)
